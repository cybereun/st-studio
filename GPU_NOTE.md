# GPU Acceleration Activated

**Problem:** Video recording was slow because it relied on the CPU (Processor).
**Solution:** I have forced the recorder to prioritize **H.264**, which is the standard format for **GPU Acceleration**.

**What this means:**
- Your **NVIDIA/AMD/Intel Graphics Card** will now handle the video creation.
- This is much faster and prevents the "Slow Motion" effect.

**Action:**
Refresh the page and try rendering again. It should be smoother!
(Check `localhost:3003` if 3002 is busy).
