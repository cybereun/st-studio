# Update Notes

**Changes Applied:**

1.  **Progress Bar Fixed:** The rendering progress bar now clearly shows the fill percentage visually.
2.  **Playlist Icons:** Changed the standard move icons to clear **Up/Down Arrows** (Chevron) for better usability.
3.  **Filename Logic:** Verified that the filename you type is used. Note: Ensure you type into the box; the grey text is just a placeholder!
